# Learning Resources

A collection of tutorials and mini-projects from the respective creators in youtube - their tutorials are referenced as links in the first line after the heading in each Jupyter Notebook

All data to be used in each notebook (saved in the data folder) must either be:
- downloaded to the same directory/folder as the Jupyter notebook, or
- the full file path of your local/working folder (in which you saved the respective file) must be appended along with the filename in the `read_...` functions
